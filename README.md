# **School\_District\_Analysis**

**Overview of Project**

**Background**

The Client asked for data analysis relating to student funding and student standardized test scores at the City School District. This data will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions at the school and district level. The data was treated with confidentiality adhering to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. The data was analyzed to showcase trends and school performance, however, Due to evidence of grade tampering the client asked for a second analysis.
